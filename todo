Right now the simulator hierarchy looks like:

dnn_sim
  dram_interface
  control_processor
  datapath
    buffers
    NFU pipeline

the control processor has pointers to datapath and dram_interface which it can use to micromanage them (everything is public)
  we can convert this to a proper interface later

start with datapath, assume input buffers are full, ignore memory

TODO:
  centralize stat collection?
  simple memory model
  DRAMsim?
  create proper interface for datapath
